abstract: |
  This repository provides a modular, reproducible pipeline to evaluate the impact of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on accuracy and hallucination reduction for small open-source LLMs on the HotpotQA dataset. It includes configuration-driven experiments, evaluation metrics (EM, F1, hallucination rate), and notebooks for analysis and visualization.
